# Hospital-Queue-App

For a recent hackathon I participated in, I was on a team that developed a patient queueing system for a hospital. At the time I knew absolutely no java, so I decided to try and see if I now have the skills to be able to make the application. So thats exactly what this application is.

This application has the following uses as of now:
  > You can register new patients
  > You can view a patients information
  > You can move a patient around in the queue
  
Uses that I am working on:
  > Being able to search up patients and view their information
  > Being able to assign a patient to a room
  > Storing all of the rooms and patients under a hospital class
  > Being able to view the current queue and sort the patient based on their spot in the queue
